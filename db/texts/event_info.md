## Oct 27 & 28, 2016 - Pittsburgh, PA
## 2016 Call for Proposals (CFP)

<strong>Submissions are open until April 30, 2016 at 5pm ET.</strong> All submitters will be notified about whether they have been selected or not by the end of May at the latest.

We're so excited that you're submitting to Rust Belt Rust 2016! If you have any questions, please email <a href="mailto:cfp@rust-belt-rust.com">cfp@rust-belt-rust.com</a>. That address goes to Rust Belt Rust organizers who have recused themselves from the blinded rounds of review.

Please feel free to submit more than one proposal! We will only choose at most one talk per person.

By submitting, you are agreeing to abide by our <a href="http://www.rust-belt-rust.com/conduct.html">code of conduct</a>.

### What we're looking for

Rust Belt Rust 2016 is going to be two days long. Day 1 will be for more interactive, longer workshop-style talks. Both full (6 hour) and half (3 hour) day workshops will be considered. Day 2 will be a single track of talks around 30 minutes in length.

We're open to any topics related to the Rust programming language!

### Proposal Form

The proposal form is divided into four sections, each used as criteria for acceptance:

_Talk Information_: is the primary data used during proposal evaluation and selection. Please help us avoid unconscious/unintentional bias by not including personally identifying information in this section, including gendered pronouns, websites, or company names.

_Balancing Information_: is used to provide contextual information about proposals and how they would fit together as a whole conference. There are no wrong answers to these questions!

_Personal &amp; Contact Information_:  __We will never share or publish any of your information without your explicit permission.__ If you are selected to be a presenter, we will contact you for permission to share some details (like your name and twitter handle) on the website.

_Making Life Easier_: The questions here only come into play if you are chosen to be a presenter. The information collected here does not factor into the selection process. Rather, it makes it easier for us to move forward with you as a speaker and attendee. We will be able to publicize and celebrate you as soon as you confirm your selection.

### Completing the CFP form

Required fields are marked with a red asterisk
(<span class="required">*</span>). After you submit your proposal, you'll receive both a browser and email confirmation of your submission.
